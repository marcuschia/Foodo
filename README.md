# Foodo
This source code provides example for Food Donation App.

Foodo is an app which aims to reduce food waste by donating extra food to those who are in need. 
Each year around 8,000 tones of wasted food was produced, & suprisingly 45% among of the solid waste are contributed from food.
The typical communication often fails to deliver between donors & the collectors. eg. Sometimes those who are in need might not be able to receive what they really need.
Foodo creates a fun & intuitive way to deliver smooth communication between them. We are bringing the concept to people that making a donation is fun, quick & easy.
Donors will be able to create a donation request on the board list, while the collectors would be able to create a collection request on what do they need.
